In addition to managing the department, I support qualitative researchers with data analysis.\n\n\n\nAs a founding organizer of the Data Rescue Project, I research and write about the Federal Statisitcal System and government information preservation.\n\n\n\nAs a historian, I’ve focused on the nineteenth century American and British anti-imperial movements. My dissertation Looking Forward: Sovereign Responsibilities in the United States and Great Britain, 1894-1920 is available from UNCG’s NC DOCKS. Feel free to read and send me feedback! My current project examines Lucia Ames Mead who is best known as a peace advocate but had ties to the anti-imperialist movement.\n\n\n\nThis site is a work in progress as we all are."
